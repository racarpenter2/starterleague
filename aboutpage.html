			<p>Although I was born and raised in Oconomowoc, WI, my family now resides in Florida, and I call Tampa home.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>I received my Undergraduate degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a double major in Finance, Investment and Banking as well as Management and Human Resources, and a double minor in Spanish and European Studies. During my second year at UW-Madison, I spent a semester in Barcelona, Spain, and studied International Trade and International Business.</p>
			<br/>	
			<p>I had an internship in the summer of 2011 working as an administrative assistant for a sports franchise in Tampa, Florida, working alongside future hall of famer Derrick Brooks. During my first two years at UW-Madison, I worked for a program called SAFEwalk and was responsible for the management of a team of six people. I left this role in my third year to pursue a position working in Human Resources for Epic Systems Corporation, a healthcare software company located just outside of Madison, WI.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>I recently moved to Chicago to pursue a startup called Tribunat Valuation with two business partners. Now, I'm proud to say I'm a student at The Starter League!!!</p>

			<p> Tribunat Valuation LLC (the Company or Tribunat) provides a new economic model for equity analysis and valuation information for investors to make wise investment decisions. The Tribunat Concept is a knowledge-based community encompassing three functions: Valuation, Exchange and Shares.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>The next evolution in social media and knowledge management is the formation of knowledge communities, mixing the creation of specialized insight of value and social collaboration with an obligation to advance the competency of the community as a whole.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>The Tribunat community progresses the intrinsic value approach to making investment decisions. With each function of the Tribunat Concept, the knowledge community has the information, insight and credibility to conspire in determining the intrinsic value of U.S. publicly traded companies. This provides the community of experienced and interested investors the intelligence they need to make wise investment decisions.</p>
