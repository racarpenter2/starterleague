				<h2>The Starter League: Advanced HTML & CSS</h2>
				<br>
				<h3>Week One</h3>
				<h4>Performance and Organization</h4>
				<p>The first week of class we focused on Performance and Organization. We began with strategy and structure, learning to efficiently develop a code base and organize our styles with CSS. We began to think of a website as a system (OOCSS vs SMACSS) and practiced decreasing our specificity and avoiding ID tags.</p>
				<p>The biggest takeway I got from class this week was how to utilize reusable code and simplify your CSS, so that you can make changes to the HTML and not worry about stylizing every new aspect. Classes are king!</p> 
				<p>For homework I designed the first version of this webpage. I added three tabs in the navigation bar, for home, about, and experiements.  I filled in all the content and designed the basic styles.  I also created a set of alert boxes in the <a href="file://localhost/Users/Rachel%20Carpenter/Desktop/experimentspage.html">experiments page.</a></p>
				<br>
				<h3>Week Two</h3>
				<h4>Detailed Positioning</h4>
				<p>Although I missed class this week (oops!) I got quite a bit out of reading the lesson on detailed positioning. The first section focused on containing floats, and outlined several strategies, including the Overflow Technique and the Clearfix Technique.</p>
				<p>The Overflow technique invovles simply adding the overflow attribute with a value of auto. The Clearfix technique uses before and after pseudo-elements on the parent element to contain the floats by creating hidden elements above and below the parent. We then learned about the position property, allowing for more control over elements.Next we learned about the z-index, and how to change the order of stacked elements.</p>
				<p>For homework this week I practiced containing our floats in different columns within the website, and added a link to my company website with a tooltip built in, so that when you hover over the link a box pops up telling you where the link leads you - this can also be found in the <a href="file://localhost/Users/Rachel%20Carpenter/Desktop/experimentspage.html">experiments page.</a> </p>
				<br>
				<h3>Week Three</h3>
				<h4>Complex Selectors</h4>
				<p>During the third week, we had a lesson on complex selectors, which help shape the cascade and style up the elements. We first reviewed common selectors such as type, class and id, and then delved into child selectors, including descendant and direct child.</p>
				<p>Next was sibling selectors, and we learned of two kinds: general and adjacent sibling selectors. The next section covered attribute selectors, which allow you to style an element based upon whether an attribute is present and what it might contain.</p>
				<p>The last section this week covered Pseudo-Classes. Pseudo-Classes are not directly stated within the markup, but are populated as a result of document structure or user actions. We covered everything from a basic hover pseudo-class to the complicated nth-of-type.  Nth-of-type required a bit of basic algebra, but was generally easy to understand.</p>
				<p>The very last section covered Psudo-Elements, which also don't exist within the document tree but allow unique parts of the page to be stylized. We learned textual, generated content, and fragment. For homework this week, we created this journal page, and utilized the complex selectors we learned to indent the paragraphs and add lock and new window icons next to links.</p>
